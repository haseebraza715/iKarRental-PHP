Car Listing: Displays all available cars with key attributes (e.g., model, price, availability).
Navigation: Clicking a car's card or name redirects to its dedicated details page.
Filters: Advanced filtering by criteria (e.g., model, price) and date ranges for availability, ensuring users find cars matching their needs.

Car Details Page

Detailed View: Showcases car attributes (e.g., model, features, price) and a high-quality image.
Booking System: Allows users to book a car for specific dates using a calendar view that restricts selection to available dates only.
